death of Thomas Boydell, 220 Richard IL, it is found that the deceased held
“Lacheford culn passagio pontis de Weryngton⁷' from the Earl of Chester in
capite.

In the plea to a quo warranto, temp. Henry VII., (Ormerod, iii. 444) Henry
Byrom and Constancc his wife, and Jamcs IIolte and Isabella his wife, (the re-
presentatives of the Boydell privileges,) claim for themselves and their heirs, in
right of the said Constance and Isabella, to have chiminum de Lacheforde ἃ heys
de Lacheforde usquc ad aquam juxta Weryngton, and claim also ‘⁶ passagium ultra
aquam de Mersey Runcorn et Thelwall ;'⁷ and, in right of this passage, claim for
every man and his horse passing the said water from Runcorn up to Thelwall a
farthing, and for every laden horse a farthing, for every laden wain or cart drawn
by two horses 4d., for twenty beasts of burden 4d.‚ for one hundred heifers or sheep
4d.‚ and for twenty unbroken horses or mares 4d., and for a smaller number accord-
ing to the same rate. It is clear from the inquisition on the death of Thomas
Boydell, that the credit of the first bridge can no longer be ascribed to the first Earl
of Derby, and it is equally clear from the passage 111 the text, that the first bridge
had fallen into decay before the date of the manuscript. When and by whom the
first bridge was built, and when and how it fell into decay, remain for our future
enquiry. It is clear, I think, that the Earl of Derby's structure was entirely new.
In the Kuerden MSS. we have the following passage :—J olm le Webster de Wer-
yngton relaxavit Roberto de Sothewurthe 2 mess. 813 2 gardin. 111 Weryngton in 18
Νο1115 street, ad terminum vitae ejusdem. It may be obseiwed, that this deed very
probably relates to premises nearly adjoining to those mentioned in the text, and
that the name of Norris occurring in it may very possibly be derived from the
Norris property in the same neighbourhood, and which the Earl of Derby subse-
quently acquired when he built the new bridge.

Amongst the deeds in Lord Lilford's possession are two which throw additional
light 011 this subject. By the first of these, dated 33 Edward Ι., Willielmus le
Botiller dominus de Weryngton grants to Jordan Fitz-Robert de Sonke a plat of
land near the bridge of Merse of the one part, and the Silche which falls into the
water os Mersey ; and by the other, dated in the same reign, but of which the year
is uncertain, the same Willielmus le Botiller grants to William de Hereford unam
placeam terrae jacentem inter Domum Laurentii Pistoris et pontem de Merse in
Weryngton et unam acram terrae jacentem in Alderswell propinquiorem fossato
fratrum Sancti Augustini de Weryngton. The site of the ancient ferry was un-
suitable for the erection of a bridge, for the ground was low and peculiarly liable to
floods, while the soil was soft and marshy, and did not on either side admit of a
solid foundation for the piers. In choosing the site of a bridge it was necessary,
therefore, to move lower down the river towards the situation where the present
bridge stands, and from the deeds which have been just mentioned it may be safely,
Ι think, inferi-ed that the first bridge stood very nearly on the site of the present
