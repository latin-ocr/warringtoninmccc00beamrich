Psalmist's exclalliatioii, that “wc are fearfully and wonder-
fully made.⁷’

Our modern luxuries of gas and water-works, as well as
the wonderful convenience of canals and railways, were
things unrevealed, even in vision, to the chronicler of these
ancient pages. Our noble river, in one direction more navi-
gable, though less navigated iu his day, was free from the
impurities with which population and manufactures have
since corrupted its waters. No effort had been made to
render the stream navigable towards Manchester3 and pro-
bably various fish-yards, and other similar enclosures, would
interrupt its course above the limits of the tide. In those
days, when the necessity was greatest, our ancestors did not
possess the use osa fire engine. They certainly had neither
a stage coach, nor any public conveyance,—-and locomotion,
especially to distant places, must have been in that age
a work of time and difficulty. The via bigalis de Arpley,
and several similar ways, are mentioned. The wain, whence
the name was derived, was probably the only carriage
known in Warrington at that time.

The four principa] approaches to the town will be found
to have existed then, as now, for all of them are mentioned
in the manuscript, and some of them by several names,
although they are not all of them designated after the
great towns to which they lead. Thus, we have—

Via ducens a villa de Werington versus Knottisforthe.
Alta via ducens a villa de Lacheforthe versus civitatem
Cestriae.
