INTRODUCTION. lxvii

the neighbouring village of Winwick,l is spelt Qwinwick or
Wynqwik; while Whitaker, appears as Qswyteakyr3 a mode
of spelling which is also Scottish in its character. We find
the family of Torfote frequently occurring in Chcshire In—
quisitions, in connexion with the sergeanty of the gaol at
F rodsham. Another name, the name of Urlestoles or Hurl-
stools‚ may remind the reader of that Scottish incident re-
corded in Sir Walter Scott's Tales osa Gramffiztlmr, (vol. i.
p. 200, second serias) when Jenny Geddes aimed her stool
at the 111-93911915 head, in the high Church of St. Giles.
An antiquary will think the name of Berdisley, which 15
found in the list, worthy of remark from its connexion with
Sir Peter Leycester who 19115 115, (Histoo'gy of Buekrlow Hem-
dred,) that Blanche, the fourth wife of Thomas Leycester,
one of his ancestors, circ. 14111 Henry VIII. was the ric-h
widow of Oliver Berdisley of Warrington, whose name 1135
occurred several times in 1119 course of 11115 Introduction.
ln the list of her ancient inhabitants, there is one name
which every friend to Warrington will rejoice to find still
remaining—the name of Patten, —-a name, which, as it is
one of our oldest local names, is also one of our best. May
that name be carried forward into the future for a still longer
period than it has already existed in our annals,——and may
it ever be, as now, amongst our names of highest honour!

 

 

1 We have a third spelling of this word in Baines's [Iistory (gfLancccslcire,
vol. i. p. 277, where we read of Robert le taillour de Wynequick,· but 93911
of these 11151311995 falls short of 1119 waste of letters committed by Sir Thos.
Stricklaud, temp. Henry VI. who, in spelling Saudwich, 11595 1119 word
Sandwightith. —Iloe'stmys ‘pl' Kendal.
