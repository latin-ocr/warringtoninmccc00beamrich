part of an acre, the ‘⁶ dole,” and the “tunge sharp,’' which
signifies a small angular piece of land; in which sense
the word continues to be used in the neighbouring village
of Ashton at the present day. The “ slada,” seems to mean
the same thing as the “pratum'' or meadow. Then we
have the ‘⁶ filum terrae'’ or strip of land, and the “lectum'’
or bed of land. Is it fanciful to suppose that the hadeland,
applicable as it is to the parts of the field lying nearest
the hedge, is derived from “Hades land'' or the “Laud of
Shades3’'

But it is time 10 bring to a conclusion these remarks,
which have already extended beyond their due limits.

A subject so local as the present can hardly be expected
to possess an interest for the general reader3 but 1116 Editor
believes that a description, so exact and minute as that con-
tained in this manuscript, of one of our provincial towns
nearly four hundred years ago, will recommend itself to the
antiquary by its own intrinsic curiosity, and will ask but
little aid from the labours of its Editor.

Something might have been done to illustrate the various
local pedigrees of this immediate neighbourhood. The fami-
lies of Bruche of Bruche, Massey of Rixton, Norris of Orford,
Penketh of Penketh, Rixton of Sankey, Sankey of Salikey,
Southworth of Southworth, and many others, well deserve
the notice of the genealogist. But the Editor has been
unable to pursue this part of the subject, and he can only
hope, therefore, that this, with many other defects of which
he is conscious in the present work, will be remedied by
some future enquirer.
