xl INTRODUCTION.

Oxford for the seat of his studies, and there his progr-ess in
the sciences, and particularly in philosophy and theology‚
was so great that he attained the highest honours usually
bestowed by that university on her best divines. Subtle in
ability, and of incredible acuteness in scholastic disputation,
he closely imitated and diligently followed John Scotus,
if he did not actually attain to all the niceties of that subtle
doctor. Upon which Ambrose Cantianus in his commen-

fortunes of the Butlers, under whom they had grown up, and whose ruin
was now impending, Penketh hall, the ancient seat of the Penkeths, seems
to have changed owners‚ much about the same time that Bewsey, the time-
honoured residenee of the Butlers, passed into the hands of strangers 3 for,
in the year 1624, we find Sir Tho. Ireland exchanging with Tho. Ashton
the hall and demesnes of Penketh, late the inheritance of Richard Penketh,
but at the same time carefully reserving to himself until the alst August

trees of fruit there growing.'' From this last passage it would seem that the
last of the Penkeths cultivated horticulture, a commendable taste, which

some passages in Shakspeare would lead us to infer was growing iu favour
with the country gentlemen of his time.
