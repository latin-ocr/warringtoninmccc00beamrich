V. Sir Peter chh, Knight.

Sir Peter Legh‚ the third in descent in the foregoing
pedigree‚ by whose orders, if not by himself, the roll of his
great possessions was transcribed‚ was the representative
in his day of a powerful Lancashire family. His grand-
father, and his father, had both died, mediately, or imme-
diately, a death of violence. The former, an active and

with the effigy of his long deceased wife at his side, while at the same time, his
shaven crown, shews the clerical tonsure, and he wears the robes of a priest
over his armour. Fosbroke (Brit. Monach. p. 292.) gives us a similar in-
stance from Connington, in Huntingdonshire, which he erroneously supposes

Journal.

This Sir Peter Legh seems to have been at great pains to obtain a general
pardon3 and several letters patent express] y pardoning him for all offences,
general and particular, are in the custody of his descendants. The necessity
for these letters of pardon might be different in those troublcsome times,
when the law was not so clear, and men's lives were not so safe3 but our
best antiquaries are of opinion that a pardon was never sought for, or
granted, unless there had existed some cause of suspicion or offence.—
