¹ The Sonkys who are mentioned here, and in subsequent pages, were landowners
in Warrington at an early period, as appears by the following curious charter‚ ex—
tracted from Lord Lilford’s evidences, and the date of which was probably about
1275 :

“ Sciant presentes ἃ futuri quod ego WVillielmus fil. Ade de Sonky et Hawys
uxor meus dedimus &e. Rogero de Sonky unum burgagium in villa de Werington,
illud scilieet quod jacet inter burgagium Thomae de Helland et burgagium Annabel
Dublerose. Habend' &e. Reddendo inde annuatim capitali domino de Weringtonfi
duodecim denarios argenti διο. IIiis testibus Rieardo Pineerna, Henrico Pineerna,
Thurstano de Holand‚ Willo de Sonky‚ dom⁰ Radulfo Capellano, Rogero de Opton,
Roberto de Witefeld clerico et aliis.’'

A little later we have a record of the Sonkys in the Aldu-aviano Rotulormn
Oriyinalium, 23 Edward I., p. 91, which shews that these humble landowners had
the spirit to resist the eneroachments of a powerful neighbour3 for, after reeiting
that Robertus de Sonky had recovered seisin before the king's justiees of the
bench against William le Butyller of VVeryngton, of and eoncerning land in
Weryngton twenty-four fect long and eight feet broad, the sheriff is commanded to
deliver possession.

The Sonkys held little Sankey a hamlet of VVarrington under the Butlers‚ and
we have evidence from time to time of homage done by them for these lands.

On the lssth January, 5 Henry VII., Randle Sonky did his homage and paid
x* for his relief. John Sonky the son of this Raudle had a son Thomas, in whom
the family spirit was not eminet, for hc was in the train of Sir Thomas Butler at
the battle of Flodden Ficld (Dth September 1513) and was there slain.
