our forefathers held their lands at the tilne when this
manuscript was colnpiled, and the wide difference existing
between some of them aud our own. Besides the tenure
‘⁶ 111 capite per servitium militare,'' which was strictly mili-
tary in its nature and origin, we meet with the following
tenures and services, which for the most part explain their

combination of these two objects in Shakspeare’s King John,
act i. se. 13) “reddendo de capitali redditu per annum vide-
licet tres denarios cum uno porco takkato vel sex dena1·ios‚'’
rendering as a yearly chief rent, three penee with one fat
pig, or sixpence3 “reddendo tres denarios et unam libram
piperis,” rendering three penee and one pound of pepper;
“tenendum tenura operationis per licentiam dicti Petri,”
holding by the tenure of doing certain work at the option
of the landlord; “ducentem ad introitum ex voluntate dicti
Ricardi,'' liberty to use a way leading to an entry during
the pleasure of the said Richard.

plendo bigam filnalem quae valet duos denarios,'’ one day's
service in filling the dung cart, which 15 worth two penee:
