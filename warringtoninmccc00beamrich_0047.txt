INTRonUoTION. xxxiii

bret missam pro anima mea parentum nostrorum et omnium
fidelium defunctorum.'⁷— Ormerod's Glaesiae, vol. i. p. 447.
The Coucher Book of Whalley, p. 409, gives us the grant
of a similar privilege, from the same donor, to that abbey.

A long interval occurs before we meet with the next
notice. “On the Sunday next after the feast of St. Martin,
3rd Richard IL, 1379, William Eltonhed‚ the prior, and his
convent grant to Sir Thomas Dutton, knight, a perpetual
chauntry, to wit, that a sufficient friar of their convent shall
be especially elected to pray for the salvation of Sir Thomas,
his children, and of Philippa his wife, and her parents, when
they shall die, at the great altar of their Church, yearly, for
ever, and that their names be written down in their martyr-
ology, whereunto the prior and convent were bound under
a penalty of 3s. 4d.‚ to be levied by the provincial prior
upon omission of such form of service3 and if for a week, or
a· fortnight‚ it were omitted, then must they double the time
omitted in manner aforesaid, if neglected for six months,
then upon pain of suspension; if for a year, then upon ex-
communication until the time omitted be made up. Where-
unto are witnesses, Thomas, abbot of St. wei-burgh, of
Chester3 Stephen, abbot of Vale Royal3 Richard, prior of
Norton3 and Roger, prior of Birkenhead. This was con-
firmed by Henry de Towesdale, provincial prior of the order
in England, with a special injunction that the said persons
be yearly twice commemorated before the whole convent,—
once, at the first entrance of the prior of Warrington into
the convocation house, yearly3 the other time, on the elec-
tion day of a fellow prior for a provincial convocation.
Dat-ed at Warrington.'' e
