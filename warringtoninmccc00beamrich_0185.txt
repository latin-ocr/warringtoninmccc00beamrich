is held of the said Peter Legh in capite by military service, which
burgage lies and is situate in Ncwgate street of tho aforesaid town
of Weryngton, to wit, upon the north shore of the sea of Mersoc,
and on the west side of the said street where the bridgc of VVeryng-

 

would be useless unless there was a causeway with arches from XVilderspool bridge,
and that Sir Thomas Ireland, knight, and Thomas Marbury, esquire, were content
to give so much land as was necessary for that good use for ever, the court said
the hundred of Bucklow should ever afterwards repair the same works 3 neverthe-
less, it is believed that this half has always been repaired by the county of Chester.

In the Kuerden papers, (ii. 607‚) we find some further particulars. On the 26tl1
Aug. 1656, the account states, it was stated before the court at Lancaster that a
deed, made thirty-five years before, by some of the earls of Derby, was in the cus-
tody of Sir Thomas Ireland, knight, at Bewsey, whereby lands called Norres's
tenement were committed to certain persons for the repair of WVarrington bridge,
and that Thomas Ireland‚ son of the said Sir Thomas Ireland, had sold, amongst
other things, the said lands unto Mr. Robert Nessd, deceased, for ³330 ; whereupon
it was ordered that the owners should pay „4:13 per annum to the surveyors of the
highways yearly for ever towards the repair of the said bridge. And we learn from
Ormerod, (i. 447) that the Earl of Derby, by his will, dated aeth J uly 1504, be-
queathed three hundred marks “to the purchase of the rent and toll of Weryngton
bridge, to the intent that the passage shall be free for all people for ever, and also
for the making up of the said bridge ccccc mares, that no toll or farm there be
asked.’' Upon these and similar statements the public opinion was founded, that
the first Earl of Derby was the founder of the first bridge at Warrington.

From the H istm-y of Olzeshire, however, (i. 446,) we learn that, by a charter of
Randle Blundeville, carl of Chester, the passage of the river Mersey, from Thclwall
down to Runcorn, was granted about the reign of Richard Ι. to Hugh Boydell of
Doddleston, lord of the manor of Latchford ; and at this time a ferry boat probably
supplanted the ancient ford across the Mersey from Warrington to Latchford.
In the 40th Edward HL, as we learn from the same authority, the renowned
Black Prince appointed certain commissioners to arrest all persons who made
passage across the Mersey by boats between Runcorn and Crosse F erry, (which
latter place was probably the Fiddlers' Ferry, about half way between Runcorn
and Warrington‚) and to commit them to the castle of Chester. The commission
here given had no doubt relation to some infringement of the privileges before
granted to the Boydells3 and its being limited to the river intermediate between
Runcorn and Cross Ferry, a place short of Warrington, affords an inference that
there already existed at the latter place some more steady passage over the river
than that afforded by a boat. And this we shall soon see was actually the case.
