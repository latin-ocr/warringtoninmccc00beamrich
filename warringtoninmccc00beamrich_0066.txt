so even 111 111959 days we may suppose that 501119 improvements
had been introduced which were unknown to the preceding
age, —- and which would doubtless give occasion 01 111111911111-
tion and complaint 10 501119 chronicler of the times.

“ In the discourse prefixed 10 Holinshed’s History,
[Quarterly Revz'ew for 1816, p. 4118,] the writer speaking
of the increase of luxury, mentions three things especially,¹
that are lnarvellously altered for the worse in England3 the
multitude of chimneys lately erected —the great increase 01
ledgings— and the exchange of 1199119 platters into pewter‚
and wooden spoons 11110 silver and tin: and he complains
bitterly that nothing but oak 101 building houses is now
regardedg ‘for when our houses’ (says he) ‘were built of
willow, then we had oaken 111911; but now that our houses
come to be made of oak, our men are 1101 only become
willow‚ buta great many altogether 01 51111111, which is a sore
alteration.² But though they had wooden spoens, they had
nothing in the shape 01 11 fork, but took the meat out of
the dish with their fingers3 as is clear from Tem Coryate,
who, in 1608, half a century afterwards, travelled through
France, and introduced the use 01 forks at his return home,
from which he was afterwards called Furcifer.”

In that age, and for a long period afterwards, the shops
01 1119 tradesmen were open stalls, without windows or glass3
and our ancestors had need 10 be a patient, as well as a
sturdy racc, when they waited behind their counters 101
their customers in the cold and gloomy days which visited
Lancashire in the olden time, as they still continue 10 do at
the present day.
