Hallumswall, which said hall and its appurtenances lie and are

that the fountain gave name to a well known place in Warrington called the Run-
ning Pump, and where, until a very recent period, there was an iron conduit and a
perpetual stream of spring water. If the word is Hallunswalle, it is probably a
corruption from Helenswell Í¾ and in that case, the fountain may have claimed St.

Helena, according to some authorities the patron saint of the church, for its
patroness.
