xlviii INTRODUCTION.

underneath it a coffin‚ in which were the bones of a man,
and on the left arm a large withy stick. The upper part of
the skull appeared to have been broken off and displaced.
The coffin, which was rough and unwieldy‚ had been cut
from a solid log of wood‚ and had received no exterior
polish afterwards.’'

In reference to the wand found in the above coffin, it may
be mentioned that similar discoveries have been made else-

tinylzanzsslm're, vol. iii. p. Sa) we are informed that in open-
ing an ancient coffin they found a wand lying by the body,
and something like the cover of a silver cup, which was
probably a paten‚ In this last case it may be inferred that
the deceased was an ecclesiastic, for we are informed by a
celebrated writer on British monachism, OEosbroke, p. 103‚)

abbots, might be the ferula, which was a species of crosier.
In the Warrington case, however, the emblem of the swerd
upon the tomb, and the broken skull of the tenant within,
seem to preclude the idea of his having been an ecclesiastic.
We may perhaps suppose him to have been some warrior, to
whom a pssgrim’s wand was given on his being committed

emblem of victory in death. But about the year 1825 an-
other sepulchral stone was dug up on the site of the priory,
which is now also in the Museum, and is still in perfect
