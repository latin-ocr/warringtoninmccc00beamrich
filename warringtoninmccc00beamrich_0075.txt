If we add one-third to the amount of these several rents,
we shall have their value in our present money, and we
shall consequently perceive how greatly the times have
changed, and how the proportionate rental of different
properties has varied. In the year 1464, as we learn from
Adam Smith, a quarter of wheat was worth 103. of our
present money, while the same quantity would probably, in
round numbers, be now worth sixty shillings3 but six times
the amount of any of the above rents would very inade-
quately represent the present money value of the rental
of the property; for while this process would hardly give
us a sixth of the present rental of 1116 land, it would assu-
redly not give us more than a tenth of the rental of houses
and buildings, a Cheshire acre of land, near the town, being
worth more than 36, and houses, such as those mentioned
in the manuscript, being now let for about ἕ2ἶ).

manuscript were a remnant of the feudal customs, and had
their origin in the necessit-ies of the times. At a 111116 when
money was scarce the landowner had no way of securing
the labour he required except by reserving it as a part of
his rent. “The prelates, barons, and other proprietors of
