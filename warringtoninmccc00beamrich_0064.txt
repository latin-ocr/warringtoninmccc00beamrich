ways, long ranges of narrow lights with quarrel panes,
through which the light was admitted by stealth, and the
whole front of the houses divided by ornamental panels of
black and white, distinguished in that age the exterior
architecture of Warrington houses. A type of what the
town then was might probably be found in some of the old
German villages still standing near the banks of the Rhine.
Few of the streets were of sufficient width to set off this orna-
mental architecture to advantage, for the state of the times,
and the fashion of the age, when wheel carriages, save for
agriculture, were almost unknown in the provinces, led our
ancestors to contract the space between the two sides of
the street,—-and in many cases, probably, opposite neigh-
bours might shake hands across the street froin the win-
dows of the upper stories of their houses.

The wisdom of our ancestors was not shewn in this fea-
ture of their street architecture,—by which they contrived to
exclude, where both are much needed, thc blessings of light

towns, much of the difficulty consists in repairing this evil
committed at their original foundation. Timber so largely
employed as the building material of that day, while it
greatly contributcd to the picturesqueness of the architec-
ture, exposed it at the same time to the more frequent
ravages of fire.l This danger was greatly aggravated by the
