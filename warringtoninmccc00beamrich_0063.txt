preservation. There is upon it a sculpturcd cross raguleo„
from which is suspended a shield bearing the arms of Hol-
010110, and bytho side of the cross one of the large two-handcd
swords. Thomas Holcrofte, the 81110100, was buried at
WVeaverham. This 1011111, therefore, could hardly have been
the tomb 01 1110 spoiler himself. It may, with some proba-

causeways by which it 13 now approached 011 1110 north and
south. Seacome tells 113 111111 11 was so in 1495, when
King Henry VH. visited his mother at Latham3 and that,

threw up a causeway across the marshes to the rising
ground on the Cheshire side.—— (Hzssstoqes ‘ff the Home of
Stanlezs, p. 42.) In its ground plan the town was straggling
and irregular. If we may judge from his short and pithy
description of the place, this character 01 Warrington ap-
pears to have struck Leland some 111111 century afterwards,
as it would strike a stranger at the present hour.

In all our old towns the style 01 building was much more
picturesque formerly than it is at present; and wo may judge
from some ancient specimens still remaining, that Warrington
was no exception, in this respect, to the times or the neigh-
bourhood. High and ornamental gables‚ with the upper
