01050 proximity of house to house, and by the narrow inter-
val between different sides of the streets. Internally, the
houses of our forefathers would sink in eomparison with
the habitations of the middle classes at the present day.
Their arrangement was bad and defective. The roonis,
except in a few instances designed for state, were low, small,
and badly lighted; while the division between different
apartments, was frequently effeeted by mere wood parti-
tions. The joinery and carpentry of that age, though pro-
bably inore expensive, were inferior in execution to our own.
Under all these defeets, it is evident that the ventilation of
their chambers must have been in excess3 which, in an age
when wood was the principal fuel, and coal,l even in this
neighbourhood, was comparatively little used, would make
the abodes of our ancestors cheerless and chilly. But yet,
as in the days of Horace the complaint was—

1 Amongst the Tower reeords are three royal charters, bearing date re-
spectively, 3 Ed. IL, 15 Ed. IL, and 12 Ed. HL, and granting for the pur-
pose of effecting repairs in the bridges and pavements, certain temporary
customs on articles brought into XVarrington for sale. In the two first of
these charters a custom of one fai-thing is imposed on every 100 faggots and
every 1000 turves, and of one halfpenny on every cart lead of wood or wind
blown timber, and no mention is made of pit coal. But the last of the
charters imposes a eustom of one penny 011 every 1000 faggots, one farthing
011 every 10,000 turves, one penny on every ship load of tui-ves, and one
halfpenny weekly 011 every cart lead of wood and eoals (carbonum). Hence
it is evident that pit coal was not unknown to our ancestors in the times of
which we are treating, although probany its use at that period was by no

means extensive.
