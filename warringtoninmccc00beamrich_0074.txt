On a review of the several holdings mentioned in the
manuscript, we find that a single acre of lneadow land in
Arpley, probably of the first quality, let for 35. 4d. a ²vear.
That t-wo inessuages ancl gardens in the market place, pro-
duced each a rent of 85. 4d.; ancl another newly-built house,
in the same situation, fetched a rent of 115. 411. Two gar-
dens are let, the one at 3s. and 1119 011191 31 25. rent. Seve-
ral other messuages fetched a rent· of 5s. 4d. each; while
sixteen other houses, let with one hundred and twenty-eight
acres of land, fetched the gross sum of 313. 145. Sd„ or
about 25. 1{d. per 3919, accounting the houses 35 lnerged in
the value of the land. In another 9359, where land is let
without 3 1101159, we find four acres let 31 3 19111 of 4s. 2d.
or 15. {cl per acre; ancl this probany would 119 nearly the
average rent of fiu·n1i11g land in lVarrington at that day.
In this estimate the personal services, where they are

payable, are accounted for at the commutation price fixed
upon them in the rental, that is—
