hired servants, under the dircction of their bailiffs. But
these great landholders having often led their followers into
the fields of war, their numbers were gradually diminished,
and hired servants could not be procured on reasonable
terms.” But this reservation of services was early felt to
be a considerable grievance to the commonalty, for we are
told by Froissart‚ (vol. ii. p. 652) in a former age, that the
variety of services required by the lords, was amongst the
alledged causes of the rebellion headed by Wat Tylen—
“The commonalty are bound by law, and custom, to plough
the lands of the gentlemen‚ to harvest the grain, to carry it
home to the barn, to thrash and winnow it: they are also
bound to harvest the hay, and carry it home.'' On the sale
of the Manor of Warrington in 16:28, a regular account was
taken of the number and value of the services of this kind
to be performed yearly by the tenants of the estates for-
merly belonging to the Butlers, and it was found that there
were—

Thirty-six ploughs at ..................... ls. Sd. each.
Forty harrom at ........................... ‘7d. each.
Sixty-six shearers and fillers of dung at 4d. each.

Some of these boon services have already disappeared‚ but
others still continue in various parts of the country; these,
however, are fast wearing out, and it will probably not be
long ere they finally disappear. Money in the market it will
be found will secure better services than those which are
rendered in this indirect way‚—while those who render
them must find the burden oppressive and vexatious.
