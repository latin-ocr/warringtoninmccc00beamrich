construction, and we shall probably not be wrong in supposing that their first
bridge at XVarrington over our noble stream was a solid structure of stone.

Ignorant as we are of the exact date of its erection, we are equally ignorant of
the date when the first bridge disappeared. It was standing, however, in ’201511
Richard ΙΙ. (1397,) and in 1465, the date of the manuscript, it was standing no
longer, for we read in the text, “ ubi pons stetit 3³³ but how long it had then dis-
appeared, we are not informed. We cannot, however, imagine that our forefathers
did not experience great inconvenience from the interruption of the usual commu-
nication between the two counties for thirty years, for such at least must have been
the period which elapsed before the Earl of Derby⁷s munificent renewal of the
bridge 3 and we cannot but suspect that the long wars of York and Lancaster, and
the disturbances they occasioned, if not the actual cause of the destruction of the
first bridge, were the means which prevented its earlier restoration. There might
bc more safety in those troublous times for our hardy forefathers behind the natural
foss which the stream of the Mersey presented against their southern neighbours.
We hear nothing of the old bridge after the eve of the usurpation of King Henry
IV. 3 and no sooner had the red and white roses been united under the rule of King
Henry VII. than we see the new bridge of the Earl of Derby spanning the stream
at VVarrington.

There is a passage in Mr. Baines’s History of Lancaslzire, vol. ii. p. 352, which
requires us to understand the word bridge in a sense different from the ordinary
meaning. In the year 1362, he says, Liverpool was slowly rising into importance
and an order was issued by the king to the adiniral on the station, as well as to the
sheriff of the county and the mayor and bailiffs of the borough, to rebuild (de novo
construere) a bridge over the Mersey within their lordship. The bridge here
meant must surely have been a large serry boat 2

Turning over the pages of the F oedera for quite a different purpose, after the
foregoing note was written, 1 met with the following royal warrant of protection,
from which we learn that there had been not only one, but two bridges at XVarring-
ton before the Earl of Derby's structure3 for the expression in the warrant, “de novo
construere,'’ shows that the intended work was a re-erection of some former bridge.
It confirms also the conjecture Ι have offered as to the solidity of the old structure,
and by inference perhaps affords us some insight into the reasons why it was so
soon destroyed. Some danger was evidently even then apprehended from persons
who were jealous of the new work, and these persons might be the parties interested
111 the tolls of the ancient serry, who, it seems, took no part 111 promoting the new
work. Sir John le Botiller, Geoffrey de VVerburton, and Mathew de Rixton, were
