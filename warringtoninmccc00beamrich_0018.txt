marble abodes, unconscious of its appalling ravages, he
enters the place by one of its original gateways‚—
“He stands within the city disinterred,
And hears the auturnnal leaves, like light footfalls
Of spirits passing through the streetS.''
Shelley, vol. iii. p. 82.

In the tracks worn in the pavements, the flint bears witness
how long, and how well frequented tho streets had been by
an equestrian throng, before the period when the city was
destroyed. He enters this or that dwelling-house‚ distin-
guished by the character of its architectum, or the richness
of its decorations. He admires the splendour of the forum,
the lnagnificence of the theatres‚ or the lnaJesty of their
temples3 and, beholding on every side the multiplied traces
of ancient and advanced art, the truth of the wise man's
observation forcibly recurs to him, that there is nothing
new under the sun. But the wonder and surprise which
seized the first explorers of Pompeii, 011 revisiting its buried
recesses, may be more easily conceived than described. An
interval of more than fifteen hundred years was at once
obliterated, and the discoverers saw before them, in all their
vividness, the habits and abodes of a generation of men
who were separated from themselves by the sea of many
ages. Transported thus suddenly back, they were able to
identify the names and abodes of the former occupants of
the city; they would see and admire their domestic eco-
nomy, and their skill in the fine arts; and would grow at
once familiar with their streets, their trades, their religious
lites, their supelstitions, and their tombs!
