xvi INTRODUCTION.

faithful adherent of Richard II„ was amongst the earliest
martyrs in the cause of the House of York3 for, his loyalty
and gratitude having made him obnoxious to the Duke of
Lancaster, he was seized upon the first advance of the in-
surgent forces into Cheshire, and was shortly afterwards
beheaded, at Chester. This memorable event would seem
never to have been forgotten by his family during the
course of the long struggle which ensued. Sir Peter Legh,
the father of the compiler or author of the manuscript,
shared in the glories of Agincourt. The blood which he
shed there procured him, we are told, the honour of knight-

at Paris, in consequence of his wounds, in the year 1422,
being then about thirty-two years of age. We are not pre-
cisely informed, however, where his son, the third Sir Peter
Legh, spent his youth3 but, as his mother, shortly after the
death of her first lord, married Sir Richard Molyneux, ano-
ther Lancashire hero who had fought by his side at Agin-
court, and survived in her second marriage until the year
1439, we may safely infer that, for a time at least, Sir Peter
Legh would remain under her eye, and have before him
the examples and the precepts to be seen or heard in the
knightly halls of Seft0n3 and there he would receive such
imperfect education as was the lot of the gentry in that age,
when those who were destined for a military career, were
often compelled to bear arms and go to the field at the
early age of fifteen.—Tyler’s Hcmys of Monmozctle, vol. i.
