In the Duchy proceedings above referred to, we have from several of 1116
witnesscs an account of the testator's intention as to the foundation of Dis-

years and above, being sworn and examined, says, “It was the will and mind
of Sir Perys Legh, knight, and priest, his master, deceased, to have three
perpetual priests and two deacons, to minister and do observance in his

Sir Peter Legh’s beautiful monumental brass, at lVimvick, is amongst the
most remarkable monuments of its kind in the kingdom. From it, we know
that he survived his grand-father nearly fifty years, and his father not less
than fifty-nine years, and died in a good old age, with the family character
for prudence, which he owed, in some degree, to the lessons and examples
of his grand—father. Singularly enough, his monumental efflgy represents

him as clad in plate, girt with a sword, and wearing his knightly spui-s,
