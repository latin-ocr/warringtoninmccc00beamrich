lxxviii iN'rRODUcTION.

When the editor undertook the task of transcribing the
present work for publication, he was encouraged and as-
sisted in his undertaking by his friend, the Rev. EDMUND
S1sss0N‚ Vicar of St. Thomas’s, in Ashton in Makerfield‚ in
this county‚-a name deservedly known to Lancashire anti-
quaries. He fondly hoped that the undertaking so begun,
would have been conducted under the same valued auspices
to a conclusion, —in which case he should have committed
it to the Society and the Public with but little of the diffi-
dence and distrust which he now feels. But, alas! the
stroke of death2 which was then impendiug, has since smit-
ten his excellent friend, and has removed beyond the reach
of this world’s Praise, or blame, a man, whose high reputa-
tion as a man of letters, an anthiluary, and a mathemati-
cian, was his least recommendation, —and whose consistent
discharge of the relative and social duties‚—and above all,
whose unwearied zeal in the performance of the duty of his
high office as a Christian Minister‚—dema11d‚ to describe
them justly‚ a language which would sound like adulation.
Deprived of the assistance which he had calculated upon,
and which would have secured for his labours some value, the
editor has only to hope that the Society will extend to him
such a degree of favour as a workman may claim who sud-

denly loses his directing head at the outset of an anxious
adventure.
