now so universal in this neighbourhood, must have prevailed
to a considerable extent at the date of this manuscript, for
we meet with mention of this circumstance 011 almost every
page.l But there were in that day large commons called
heaths, still remaining uninclosed on different sides of the
town, all of which have been long since brought under culti-
vation. Besides the ‘⁶ fovea” or pit, which was very probably
a fox earth, we find frequent mention of the “puteus’' or

and it might have been wished that the writer of the manu-
script had given us more glimpses into the modes then in
use of cultivating or improving the soil. We read often of
fields which are called the Brandearth; whence we may, I
think, infer that the mode of bringing the soil under culti-
vation, by burning the turf or surface, was then, as it con-

are mentioned in one place; and we read of a “campum
noviter marleriatum‚'' a field recently marled3 “una acra
terrae cum uno approvamento ad marlei·ium superponendum

prodigious clamours from those who mistook the effect of depopulation for
its cause.
