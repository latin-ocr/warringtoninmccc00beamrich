one. The passage in the text and the mention of the Silche in one of the deeds, the
latter being the drain or syke which runs into the river a few yards to the east
of the present bridge, combine to render this probable. As soon as the bridge
was built, which is at a distance of not more than half a mile from the parish
chureh, where the town had hitherto terminated, buildings and population soon
began to be attracted towards the spot where the new communication was opened,
and the street of Newgate, the modern Bridge street, was gradually formed. The
priory would soon follow. For reasons before alluded to, I am inclined to think it
did not lead the stream. It is true that the 33 Edward I., when the bridge is first
mentioned, precedes the first express mention of the priory by many years; but
not long after the battle of Evesham, in 1265, we find Richard the hermit, of XVar-
rington, (almost certainly an Austin friar,) making a pilgrimage to the tomb of St.
Simon the righteous‚ (see Introduction) and both the bridge and the priory were
probably then standing.

The conjecture of Mr. Ormerod, (Uist. of Cheslzire, vol. i. p. 447) that the date
of the erection of the bridge was intermediate between the two Boydell inquisi-
tions, must now be abandoned since the discovery of Lord Lilford's (leeds, and we
shall still have to inquire at what earlier period than the 33d Edward Ι. the first
bridge was erected at XVarrington.

For nearly a century after the Norman Conquest there was little territorial
connexion between the earldom of Chester and the lands between Ribble and
Mersey. But about the year 1153 the lands between Ribble and Mersey were
granted by King Stephen to Randle Gernons, earl of Chester. In those dayS,
however, a parchment did not always immediately give a settled possession, and
Stephen’s authority would require to be confirmed, as it afterwards was by his
next successor on the throne. Randle Gernons survivcd the confirmation of the
royal grant but a few years, and, dying in 1160, was succeeded by Hugh Kyveliock
as lord of the Cheshire palatinate. During his enjoynient of the earldom, which
continued until 1182, when he died, we find but little mention of the possessions
between Ribble and Merscy ; but in the vigorous hands of his immediate
successor, Randle Blundeville‚ the Lancashire possessions of the earldom seem
to have been made available to their owner. In order to draw closer the com-
munieation between the two counties, the grant before referred to was made by him
to the Boydells, of the passage over the Mersey 3 and I should date the erection of
the bridge soon after the period of that grant. We have no information as to what
were the materials of the first bridge, nor what was its form, and we are equally
ignorant whether it was destroyed by the land floods, by the violence of inan, or by
the slow hand of time. If we knew the cause of its destruction, we might with
some probability inser the nature of the fabric. Our ancestors, wiser in this
respect than their sons, were not apt to erect their public buildings of a flimsy
