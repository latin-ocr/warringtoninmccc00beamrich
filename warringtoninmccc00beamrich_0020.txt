minutes like the following occurring in various places,
shew that it has been carefully examined by the writer.
As for instance, at pages 218 and 236 of the original,
we read “corrigitur istuc;'’ and at page 260, “corrigitur
hucusque.” It is bound in a strong original binding,
which is probably as old as the volume3 but the letter-
ing on the back, “Manuscript relating to Lyme Estate,''

it was begun on the third Wednesday of Lent, in the year
1465, [ie. accordIng to the civil and legal computation‚]

reconcile the above year of Grace with the year of the

civil and legal, and not the historical computation, for as
Edward IV. began to reign, according to the latter, on the
4th of March, 1461, and as the manuscript was commenced
on the 5tl1 of March, the writer of the manuscript must
necessarily have written the year 1466, unless he had been
guided by the computation which we have supposed. But
a passage in Hollinshed's Clm'om'cles, (p. 664,) will serve to
make this matter more clear2—“King Edward'' says he,
“was proclaimed in the year of the world 5427, and from
the birth of our Saviour 1461, after our accompt‚ beginning
the year at Christinas, but after the usual accompt of the
Church of England, 1460.” After all, however, there seems

to have been some uncertainty in the writer's mind as to -
