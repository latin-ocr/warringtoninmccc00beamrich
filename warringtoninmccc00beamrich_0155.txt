burton in the tenure of Henry Garnet on the south3 all which
aforesaid premises render unto the said Peter yearly ........
with two days' service in autumn, worth four peuce a year.

J oHN HAKYNSALL of WVeryngton holds of the said Peter Legh
one messuage with a garden adjoining in the said place called
Pratte rowe, with a barn and garden lying in breadth between the
king's [highway or] street which leads from the said market place
of XVeryngton towards Beawsee and VVynwhick on the east and a
garden of the said Peter in the tenure of the said William Mul-
yngton on the west, and extending 111 length from a messuage and
garden of the said Peter in the tenure of Ralph Sothurne on the
south, as far as the garden of the said Peter in the tenure of the
said John Dychefeld on the north.

Also he holds one acre of land in a field called -Cocage inclosed
with hedges and ditches, lyfing in breadth between a field of Randle
de Rixton in the tenure of William Kyngeley on the north and a
field of the said william Botiller in the tenure of Ralph Kellur-
margh on the south, and extending in length from land of Mary
late the wife of Hamund Assheton on the west as far as' certain
burgages ................ in the tenure of Thomas Balfrunte on
the east 3 and on the western side of the aforesaid acre of the said
Peter in the tenure of the said John Hakynsall a certain way has
been made by the twelve jurors, because it is found not to have
been a bui-gage either heretofore or now Sec.

Also he holds two acres of land within a certain small enclosure
enclosed with hedges and ditches, and commonly called 10 Orym-

 

seems to be owing to this spirited resistanee of our forefathers against an 1110100011-
ment on their rights. The interference here, to his honour 50 faithfnlly recorded
by the Legh chronicler‚ has probably been the means os prescrving to us that por-
tion of the road over Cockhedge, which crosses the field lately rented from Thomas
Legh, esquste, as a depository for the street sweepings and paving stenes.

4 The term burgage is here applied with reference to the exercise of some pri-
vilege to be exercised in the maner court ; and the twelve men who are here found
asserting the public right by drawing “a ploughshare” across the site of the as-
sumed buigage, were no doubt the jury of the court baron.
