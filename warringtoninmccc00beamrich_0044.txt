XXX INTRODUCTION.

marked by 1119 existence of a White Cross, the situation of
which is still denoted by its name,—
“ Stat nominis umbra.''

Mention having been made of the Austin Friars, Ι may
be excused for introducing here, in a succinet order, such
particulars as I have been able to glean respecting them
and their house at Warrington; although some of those
particulars may have already appeared in print. In the An-
tz'qm‘ties of staford, printed with Hearne’s T emiza-5 Rff‘bnsis,
p. 339, we learn that all the Hermit Friars, formerly called
by a variety of names, were brought into one company by
Pope Alexander IV. who styled them, “Fratres Eremitarum
Sancti Augustini.’' Alexander wore the tiara from 1243 10
1261; and it is a proof how soon the new order began to
spread itself, that in 1252 we find Lanfranc of Milan, the
general of the order, dispatching some of the body 011 a
1111331011 10 11113 country. Religious novelties, when once in-
troduced, were of rapid growth in that age. In a few years
from their first arrival, the hel-mit friars had built their
great house at Oxford; where their celebrated disputations
bequeathed a name to the exercises :for the degree of a
Master, which were long called “Keeping of Augustines.”
They had also commenced 1119 erection of their house in
London‚ some remains of which, though of a later date,

obvious reason, that if they had been like the great Monastcries‚ in distant
solitudes, their mendicant inhabitants must have wanted bread.’' And this
is confirmed by a poetic distich on the same subject:—

“ Bernardus valles, colles Benedictus amabat

Oppida Franciscus‚ magnas Ignatius urbes.'’
