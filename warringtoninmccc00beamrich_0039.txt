INTRODUCTION. XXV

short time after the close of the fifteenth century, we find
the following entry:—

7111 Henry VIII. Tho. Boteler v. Sir Tho. Gerard—charge ,
of assault‚ at a cock fight.

And also at a later period the following cases:—
37111 Henry VIII. Sir Tho. Butler υ. Tho. Molyncux — charge

of assault.
37th Henry VIII. ThoMolyneux v. Sir Tho. Butler and Eliza-
beth, his wife — charge of 35531111, with intent of rape.

3rcl Edward VI. Sir Tho. Butler υ. Τ110. Butler and Richd.
Bruche —— charge of 35531111, with intent to murder.

These cases, in which the parties were knights, 01· gentle-

the time. There do not exist against Sir Peter Legh any
charges of similar violence: but we have abundant proof
that he was not slew to defend his rIghts at law, since we
have in the manuscript frequent entries such as this, “alia
parcella pendet in lite et dissentione3'' and to shew the ill
blood arising out of this matter, a neighbouring gentleman,
of considerable landed consequence, Mr. Brotherton‚ of the
Hey, is often designated in the manuscript, as “unus voca-
tus Jak of the Hey.’' Again, the desire to keep his own
would seem, at times, to have been stretched by Sir Peter
Legh 100 far; for, in one place, we have the following en-
tryz-—“ Est quadam via ducta per duodecim juratores quia
invenitur quod dicta acra dicti Petri non fuit burgagium in
antiquo tempore neque moderno.” But in those days, vio-
lence, and the strong arm, were a more f‘avourite resort

than now3 and it is 0110 sign of our increasing civilization‚
