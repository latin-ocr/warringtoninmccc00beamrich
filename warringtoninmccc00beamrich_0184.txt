1Ι1 may not be improper to inquire here at what period the first bridge was
erected over the Mersey at Warrington. An opinion prevailed which was implicitly
received until the publication of the H istoru of Cheshire, that to the Earl of Derby,
who in 1495 was honoured with a visit by his royal father-in-law‚ King Henry VII„
and to his wish 10 facilitate the royal progress, we are indebted for the first bridge
at Warrington. During the Roman period, when the passage over the Mersey at
this place was the entrance to a new province, and was consequently held in much
estimation, a ford was the only means of communication. The ford, as there is
every reason to believe, was at some distance from the present bridge, and was made
to enter Latchford near to a place now called the Wash. The works sor making
the river navigable, and an extensive desertion by the river of its ancient bed, in
consequence of a violent flood which occurred nearly a century ago, have now nearly
obliterated every trace of the former site of the ford.

The writer of the story of the Bewsey tragedy, in the Bodleian collection, makes
the dispute which originated it arise out of Sir John Butler's claim to take toll for
passing over the Mersey. “ King Henry the VII.” (says the story) “ being come
to Latham, the erle Sir J ohn’s brother in law sent unto him a message to desire
him to wear his cloth at that time ; but in his absence his lady scorn’d that her
husband should wayte on her brother, being as well able to entertaine the king as he
was, which answer he tooke in great disdeigne and prosecuted the said Sir John
with all malice that could be, and amongst other things the said 811· John had a ferry
at Warrington which was worth 0. mares by the year unto him, there being no
bridge z and the erle coming to go to London, the said Sir John would 1101 suffer
him to pass, but forced him about by Manchester, whereupon the erle bought a
piece of land of one Norris of Warrington‚ by which means he was privileged to
......... 011 1116 011161· 51(16, and 50 builded a bridge at Warrington, ou both sides
being his own land 3 and the said Sir John Butler after the bridge was builded did
notwithstanding exact and take toll and tax of all passengers as before, whereon
the erle caused the king to make it free. On that and such like discontents they
tooke arms against one another.”

In the Introduction 10 11115 work we have given Seaeome’s version of the cause of
the building of the bridge. At the general quarter sessions of the peace for the
county of Chester, held at Nantwich on the 13111 J uly 16:24, the grand jury pre-
sented the Cheshire half of Warrington bridge, and found that Edward, son of
Thomas earl of Derby, did, at his own charge, repair the same, and Henry, the son
of Edward, did likewise 3 and they thought that William, the then earl, ought to
repair the sa1nc; 11111 they desircd the advice of his majesty’s justit-es at Chester,
