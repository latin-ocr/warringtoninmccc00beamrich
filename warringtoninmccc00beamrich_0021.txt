INTRoDUcTION. vii

which computation 110 ought 10 use, for in a subsequent
page in the volume, where he has given a separate heading
for the description of the Lylne estate, he tells us that
that portion of the work was written on the 29tl1 of March,
1466, anno Regni Edward IV. 6⁰3 from which it follows
that he must, in this latter instance, have adopted the his-
torical, and not the legal and civil computation.

We have no positive evidence of the actual hand by
whom the book was written, nor do we know with certainty
whether it was the work of the knightly owner, whose pos-
sessions it so minutely records; or of one of his two chap-
131115, whose names we shall have occasion to introducet, or
by some Scottish agent, who betrays his country by his
occasional spelling of the names of places. The adoption of
an ecclesiastical mode of dating would seem to point out the
profession of the scribe,—-while, on the other hand, there
are reasons for supposing the knight to have been his own
amanuensis. Notices occur, here and there, of what he
intended to do in matters, some of which are not imme-
diately connected with his subject3 and once or twice, the
expression meets us, “ut ipse dicit‚’' while in an age when
the statute of additions was in full force, and knighthood
was punctilious of respect, he is constantly spoken of as the
“said Peter? or the “said Peter Legh,'’ without further
addition. Hence there arises a strong presumption that
Sir Peter Legh penned the work himself 3 a presumption
which will be further strengthened hythe magistrates’ forms
occurring at the end of the volume,--a circumstance which
will be alluded to in the sequel.
