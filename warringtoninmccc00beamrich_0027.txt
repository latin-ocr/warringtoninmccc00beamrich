1524«.l Hc was party to the singular award about the Asshe-
ton arms. His wife Ellen Savage, according to Ormcrocl,
(vol. i. p. 429) had been previously married to Peter Warbur-

 

 

1 This Sir Peter, by his Will, directed his executors to take and perceive
all the issues aud profits of certain hereditaments therein referred to during
a term of ten years,—-“All which issues and profits thereof to be taken
and received by his said executorS, he vvilled should bc conveyed to the
monastery of St. WVerburgh, of Chester, and to be put in safe keeping in a
substantial coffer locked there to be standing and remaining of his costs and
charges, and that every of his executors should have a several lock and key
upon the sanie;'' the said rents to be laid out in a purchase of lands for the
use of Disley Chapel. And in certain proceedings preserved in the Duchy
Office, it appears that one of the enquiries directed to be made was, “Whe-
ther the said Sir Peter Legh willed at any time, by his last Will, that Robert
Ardcrn should have any ‘advauncement' for the forbearing of 1113 money
and whether 116 gave him the said advauncement besides his (lebt that he
ought to the said Robert, or not, and what recompense of advauncement it
was that he willed him.” Upon these two cxtracts, (for which I am in-
debted to the kindness of Mr. Hardy of the Duchy Office, Duchy Qffiee MSS,
vol. xx. M. i.; and vol. xx, l. 3, a. fol. 10,) we may observe the small de-
gree of confidence which Sir Peter Legh, a knight, and a priest, reposed in
the five gentlemen whom hc selected for his executors; none of them it
seems might be trusted to retain 111 1113 hands the money he received, but
was to deposit it in a strong box in the distant abbey of St.. lVerburgh, at
Chester, under five separate locks and keys3 a eumbrous procedure alike
at variance with the convenience of business, and with the trust which a
man of rank would place in his equals of the present day. Monasteries
seem to have been favourite places of custody then, and for some time
before, for in the Annales Furnesienses, p. 266, we read that on the ]3th
of October, 1345, the abbot of Furness received the royal command to find
a proper and strong room in his abbey, in which the collectors of the tenth
and fifteenth 111 11113 county, might deposit the King's moneys.

Tho transaction with regard to Robert Ardern's money is hardly less
