“Haec Albcrtns ego Stendal colibeta magister
Altiloquentis Scoti formis uberrima pressi
Religione sacra et diva celeberrimus arte
Clarus ct ingenio Augustini ex ordine Thomas
Impressum purgavit opus studio integer omni
Anglia cui patria et generis cognomine Penketh.'’

The fame of an Italian university stood high in Penketh's
day‚—-an(l hence it is easy to understand his desire
“ To see fair Padua, niu-sery of arts ς’)

for in that place his order had long enjoyed a distinguished
reputation; and at the death of Petra1·ch‚ in June, 1387,
exactly a century before his own decease, the funeral oration
over the poet’s grave was pronounced by “the Seraphic
doctor‚” Bonaventura da Praga, (Eme. Met. vol. ii. p. 646)
of the order of the hermits of St. Augustine, <Camp. Effe qs
Peli-arch, vol. ii. p. 3123) a translation of one of whose
works, in manuscript, is among the curiosities of the Chet-
ham Library.1

But Penketh’s deflection from duty in the affair of bas-
tardising the children of King Edward IV„ in order to
advance the interests of an usurper, has made his name
familiar to thousands‚ who have never heard either of his
great learning, or of his numerous works3 and such is the
prerogative of genius, that in the short speech put into the
mouth of Glo'ster—

 

1 6690. Bonaventura, (S.) ‘⁴ The Merour of the blesside Lyfe of Jesus
Christe, made English 5 with sev¹t1=acts of Richard the Herinit.” Bonaventure's
works are common in manuscript. One of them, “De mysteriis Passionis

Jesu Christis may be seen in the library of the Dean and Chapter, at Lineoln.
